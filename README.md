Welcome to the portfolio website for Matthew Campbell.

I am currently working through the Codecademy Full Stack Engineer Pro Career Path.

Please see tiles which will link to each project that I have undertaken either as a part of this career path, or as an aside to this.

If you come across this portfolio in any way, please feel free to let me know if there is anything you like/any changes that would help with readability/reducing code.

Thank you and all the best!
Matthew

<!-- Ideas for projects:
                Meal Decider:
                    Can you pick x number of meals based on number input from a chicken dish, pork, beef, fish etc but there can only be one of each with no duplication. 
                Need to build logic for this in JS before creating HTML / CSS-->
